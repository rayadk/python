# python
This is a collection of Python projects I've worked for a class I took on Coursera: "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)." This was my first foray into Python and it was awesome! All the assignments were games so it created a natural incentive to work on them :) I would highly recommend the class to anyone looking to get started with Python!

The class used CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org/), a web-based Python development environment, as a platform for writing and submitting assignments. My scripts were written here and take advantage of the platform's built-in functionality.
