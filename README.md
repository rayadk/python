# About this collection
This is a collection of Python projects I've worked for a couple classes I took on Coursera: "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" (both parts). This was my first foray into Python and it was awesome! All the assignments were games so it created a natural incentive to work on them :)

The class used CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org/), a web-based Python development environment, as a platform for writing and submitting assignments. My scripts were written there and take advantage of the platform's built-in functionality, particularly its _simplegui_ library.

From a technical perspective, the games were either console-based, GUI-based, or blended. For the latter categories, they followed an event-driven model that made use of input fields, buttons, and timers. They also leveraged keyboard and mouse input. Data structures like dictionaries, lists, and tuples were also used.
