# About this collection
This is a collection of Python projects I did for a couple classes I took on Coursera: "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python." This was my first foray into Python and it was awesome! All the assignments were games so it created a natural incentive to work on them and do lots of testing :)

In the script for each game, you can find a high-level description at the top and inline comments that give all the gory implementation details, if you're into that kinda thing.

# Running the games
To run any of the games, click on their corresponding links and hit the play button to begin:

```Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock``` - http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_JKfBKeao2bS4V4u.py

```Guess the number``` - http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_mDuf489chVFU2Ql.py

```Stopwatch: The Game``` - http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_DF6KaiYG369DqUt.py

```Pong``` - http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_ddTD4BZHw5IvRt3.py

```Memory``` - http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_WUzHfB2xjzexdmk.py

You don't have to install anything but you must have Javascript enabled and allow pop-up windows. Most any browser, aside from Internet Explorer, will work. Since some games require keyboard and mouse input, you'll want to run them on an appropriate platform.

Note: If there's a problem with any of the links, just copy and paste the code into CodeSkulptor and hit play to run it.

# Technical points
The class used CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org/), a web-based Python development environment, as a platform for writing and submitting assignments. My scripts were written there and take advantage of the platform's built-in functionality, particularly its _simplegui_ library. 

The games start off as console-based and then transition over to being fully GUI-based. In this process, they increasingly follow an event-driven model that makes use of input fields, buttons, and timers. They also leverage keyboard and mouse input. Data structures, particularly lists, tuples, and dictionaries are heavily used in the later games.
