# python
This is a collection of Python projects I've worked for a class I took on Coursera: "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)." This was my first foray into Python and it was awesome! All the assignments were games so it created a natural incentive to work on them :) I would highly recommend the class to anyone looking to get started with Python!

The class uses CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org/), a web-based Python development environment, as a platform for writing and submitting assignments for grading. My scripts were written on this platform and take advantage of its built-in functionality.

In order, they are:
1. Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock
2. Guess The Number
3. Stopwatch: The Game
