# About this collection
This is a collection of Python projects I've worked for a class I took on Coursera: "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python." This was my first foray into Python and it was awesome! All the assignments were games so it created a natural incentive to work on them :)

The class used CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org/), a web-based Python development environment, as a platform for writing and submitting assignments. My scripts were written here and take advantage of the platform's built-in functionality, particularly its simplegui library.

From a technical perspective, the games were either console-based, GUI-based, or blended. For the latter categories, they followed an event-driven model that made use of input fields, buttons, and timers. They also leveraged keyboard input. Data structures like lists and tuples were also used.

# Running these scripts
To run any of these scripts, copy and paste the code into CodeSkulptor and hit the play button. You don't have to install anything but you must have Javascript enabled and allow pop-up windows.
