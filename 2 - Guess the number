# Guess the number

# The user plays a guessing game in this program to figure out
# the secret number that's either in the range of 0 to 100 or
# 0 to 1000. In the former case, they have 7 guesses to figure it
# out and in the latter case, 10 guesses. A new game immediately starts
# after one game ends, successfully or unsuccessfully.
#
# The trick in this game is to use keep guessing half the range until
# you get the right number. This is a simple application of the
# Binary Search algorithm.

# Input will come from buttons and an input field
# All output will be printed in the console
